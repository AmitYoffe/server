i need to implement to following concepts:
1) middlewares ✅
2) Error middleware ✅
3) server-side validations (use Express-validator) ✅
4) server side 3 layer architecture ✅ 
5) doenv (for .env) ✅
6) REST Apis ✅
7) Dto ✅
8) Inversify ( dependancy injection ) ⛔

Today-TODO :
1) apply Inversify by changing functions in
  services and repositories to classes...
2) read up on http status numbers 
3) make an Enum of the status responses, 
to not make the numbers hard coded ( use library? )
4) create more index.ts file to make smaller imports if needed
5) finish going through comments!



Additional mission:
a) On top of the pictures i have in my phone, 
i need to make an additional page that shows all directors,
similar to how it shows all movies ( optional ).

b) use mongoDB if i have extra will power ( Optional ) ⛔
